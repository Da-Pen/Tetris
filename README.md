# Tetris
This is the classic Tetris game, with a twist: instead of blocks being only 4 squares in size, they can be anywhere from 1 block to 5 blocks in size.

This version does not yet have the "hold" and "view next block" features.

# Code
The code for this game was written in java, using 2DGraphics to display graphics.

# Installation
If you just want the game, please navigate to the folder named "dist" and download "Tetris.jar". If you would like the game with the source code, download the entire folder.
